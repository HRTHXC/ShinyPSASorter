## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document written for the ShinySorter application, based from the VBScript written by Harrison Crane. It helps gives easier viewing of data of PSA death in the plantations here at PFR, allowing for those users to find the successful crosses of plants, and to cull those less successful crosses.

This is an interim release prior to the development of the Online Shiny release. Input is via .csv document, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://shiny.powerplant.pfr.co.nz/PsaBlockSummary/">here</a>, for use on your client machine. You can also use the VBScript release, ask me for a copy to place on your machine (due to security concerns passing macros via email)
